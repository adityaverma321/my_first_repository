Q20 : The script receives any number of filenames as arguments. It should check whether every argument supplied is a file or directory. If it is a directory, it should be reported. If it is a filename then name of the file as well as the number of lines present in it should be reported.

Code :

for i in $@
do
        if [ -f $i ]
        then
                echo "$i is a file"
                echo -e "Number of lines in file $i is : $(wc -l < $i)\n"
        elif [ -d $i ]
        then
                echo -e "$i is a directory\n"
        else
                echo -e "$i is not a file or directory\n"
        fi
done

Output :

ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ bash q20.sh aditya.txt Public Documents demo.txt
aditya.txt is a file
Number of lines in file aditya.txt is : 10

Public is a directory

Documents is a directory

demo.txt is a file
Number of lines in file demo.txt is : 5
